Socially distance your work.  Work from home or use the six-foot rule as much as possible in the workplace.  3. Shop alone and only shop once a week.  Do not take family with you.  4. Help kids follow social distancing.  Play at home.  No group sports.  And no playgrounds.  5. Help seniors stay at home by shopping for them.  Do not visit long-term care facilities.  6.

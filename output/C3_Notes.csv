However, if an event is planned with more than 50 people a consult with the local public health office on a plan to implement adequate social distancing is recommended. Event cutoff threshold is at the discretion of community leadership based on current circumstances in that community. At this time, rodeos and fairs must follow the same guidance as all large gatherings. However, local authorities may impose more restrictive measures than the directive. If a public outdoor gathering has to be moved indoors for under 50 people and those in attendance were not wearing face coverings, attendees do need to wear face coverings now that the event has moved indoors. The face covering directive applies to indoor spaces that are open to the public, regardless of occupancy/group size.

In phase 2, only some businesses are allowed to operate with limitations, outdoor recreation allows for only 5 people to gather, gathering is limited to less than 5 people (outside the household) per week, and members of at-risk populations are recommended to stay at home.   https://web.archive.org/web/20200805105036/https://kingcounty.gov/elected/executive/constantine/covid-response/safe-start.aspx    https://web.archive.org/web/20200823115741/https://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/chart-washingtons-phased-approach",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The City of Seattle reiterated in early September that it is not issuing permits for major events until further notice - adhering to guidance from the State of Washington and Public Health - Seattle & King County.?These include major cultural events, run/walk events, street events, festivals, and vendor fairs. https://web.archive.org/web/20200928184416/https://www.seattle.gov/special-events-office/covid19-information",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

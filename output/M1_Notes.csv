Building on historic early action to expand paid sick days to employees in the food sector at the beginning of this crisis, this legislation means that every California employee that has been exposed to or tests positive for COVID-19 will have access to paid sick days for the rest of the 2020 calendar year.    AB 1867, a budget trailer bill, closes the gaps in paid sick days provided in federal law and the Governor’s Executive Order by including employers with over 500 employees and public and private employers of first responders and health care employees who opted not to cover their employees under federal law. The bill also allows California’s Labor Commissioner to cite workplaces for a lack of paid sick days, a critical enforcement tool that will promote safety for employees and customers alike.

This prohibition took effect on Saturday, March 21, 2020, at 5:00 p.m. Individuals found to be in violation are subject to investigation and enforcement by the Attorney General’s office. This executive order brings Minnesota, which does not have a statute on price gouging, in line with most other states in the United States.     Executive Order 20-11 authorized the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS) to seek federal authority to temporarily waive or modify certain requirements for federal programs, including but not limited to the Minnesota Family Investment Program, Medical Assistance, and MinnesotaCare, to ensure these programs continue providing necessary support to Minnesota families during the COVID-19 pandemic.    Executive Order 20-12 allows DHS to temporarily issue waivers or modifications to state requirements to ensure that their services can be delivered to Minnesotans safely and without undue delay, protecting vulnerable Minnesotans and those who care for them. DHS provides health care coverage, programs, and services for over 1 million Minnesotans, including groups likely to be significantly impacted by COVID-19 such as older adults, individuals who have disabilities, families with children, and individuals with mental illness.

Part of that planning includes an efficient distribution network for the vaccine so as soon as the first doses arrive, they can quickly get into the arms of Nebraskans. DHHS has not received notification of an arrival date for the vaccine.   Vaccine supply will be limited early on and initial doses may be targeted toward certain priority groups including those critical to the COVID-19 response, providing direct care, as well as those at highest risk for developing severe illness from COVID-19, and essential workforce. As supply increases, more people will be able to receive vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a COVID-19 Vaccination Program Interim Playbook in mid-September to assist states with their planning.

# U.S. Covid-19 Policy Tracker

### Output folder

The output directory contains processed datasets including daily covid-19 statistics for states and counties as well as policies in different areas of each state. We used JHU datasets(csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us & time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv) and OxCGRT(OxCGRT_US_latest.csv) to construct our dataset. The JHU datasets contain information on the Covid-19 statistics. The OxCGRT systematically collects information on several different common policy responses governments have taken, records these policies on a scale to reflect the extent of government action, and aggregates these scores into a suite of policy indices.

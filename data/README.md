# Project 2: Shiny App Development

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

The JHU dataset contains information about COVID statistics for each state and county in the United States (cases, deaths, mortality rate, incident rate, testing rate, hospitalization rate).

The Oxford dataset contains information about COVID policies enforced for each state.

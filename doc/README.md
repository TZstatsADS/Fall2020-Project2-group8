# U.S. Covid-19 Policy Tracker

### Doc folder

 In this project, we built a policy tracker to explore the interaction of state government policy response and Covid-19 statistics overtime (from 01/22/20 to 10/12/20). In particular, we want to see how some key Covid-19 statistics (confirmed cases, death, infection rate, mortality rate, positive test rate, hospitalization rate) change overtime and how the state governments are publishing corresponding containment and closure policies, health system policies, and economic policies. Business Value: Our project provides the interactive plot of state government policy and Covid-19 statistics, and it could help to answer questions such as:

How did policy stringency change with the evolving situation?
How Covid-19 statistics change after policy stringency change?
